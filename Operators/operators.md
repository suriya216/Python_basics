# Operators

In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, values, or expressions. Python supports various types of operators,

- **Arithmetic Operators**

```python
add = X + Y   # addition of two numbers
sub = X - Y   # subtraction of two numbers
mul = X * Y   # multiplication of two numbers
div = X // Y  # division of two numbers (Floor division)
# By using double slash '//' it returns the quotient in int datatype.
# Single slash will return the floating point value for the quotient.
mod = X % Y   # Operator used to find the remainder
power = X ** Y    # Power of two numbers

```

- **Comparison (Relational) Operators**

```python
x, y = 5, 10
#Relational operators return boolean values
print(x == y)   #False
print(x != y)   #True
print(x < y)    #True
print(x > y)    #False
print(x <= y)   #True
print(x >= y)   #False
```

- **Logical Operators**
- **Assignment Operators**
- **Identity Operators**
- **Membership Operators**

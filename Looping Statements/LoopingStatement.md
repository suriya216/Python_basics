# Looping Statements

In python, It provides **for loop** and **while loop** to handle the looping requirements.

### **While Loop:**

```python
while condition:
     # statements
else:
     # statements
```

This loops will continues until the condition become false, once it will false returns the else condition.

### For Loop:

For loops are usually used for the sequential traversal.

```python
for iterator in range:
    #statements
else:
		#statements
```

This loop is specifically used to traverse in a range. It is more aptable to iterates over the **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries** etc. 

This looping statements also form nested loops for traversing two dimensional arrays.

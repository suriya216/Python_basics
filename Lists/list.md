# List

```python
```
This list items can be accessed by the index values.

```python
mylist=[1print(mylist[2])
#3
```

These lists maintains insertion order as per they inserted. If we add new items it will be placed at the end of the list.

Items stored in the list is changeable and list allows duplicates which can accumulates the same value.

We can access the size of list by using `len()` function.

```python
mylist=[1,2,3,4]
print(len(mylist))
#4
```

We can access the type of list by using `type()` function.

```python
mylist=[1,2,3,4]
print(type(mylist))
#<class list>
```

List can hold multiple datatypes in a single list.

```python
mylist=[1,"apple",True,a]
print(mylist)
#[1, apple, True, a]
```

### The list() Constructor

This constructor is responsible to create new list.

It can be represented by square brackets inside a square bracket

`[[]]` .

```python
mylist=list((1, 2, 3, 4))
print(mylist)
#[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### 2D List

A list within another list is called as 2-Dimensional List

```python
mylist=[[1, 2, 3, 4],[5, 6, 7, 8]]
print(mylist)
#[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
```

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable and allows duplicate.
